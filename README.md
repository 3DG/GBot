# GBot

GBot is a bot that was made mainly for use in 3DG's server, but you may invite it to your own as well. This bot is open source so the community could fix stuff i usually wouldnt catch due to being a terrible coder :)

You may redistribute parts of this code with or without credit, but if you're using most/all of it, credit is required.
